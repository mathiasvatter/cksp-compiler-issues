# cksp - Public Issue Tracker

Welcome to the public issue tracker for `cksp`! `cksp` is a compiler/transpiler developed in C++ designed to translate cKSP files into text files utilizing the Vanilla KSP Syntax. `cksp` provides its own syntax that is more user-friendly and efficient and aims to offer features often found in modern programming languages, such as lexical scope, functions and ADTs.
Additionally, it can directly parse Vanilla KSP Syntax, offering a seamless transition for current developers.
For more information about `cksp`, please refer to the [documentation](https://mathiasvatter.github.io/cksp-compiler/index.html)
